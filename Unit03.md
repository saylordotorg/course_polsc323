**Unit 3: Case Studies in European Policies** <span id="3"></span> 
*Unit 3 covers specific case studies in European politics as well as the
EU as a whole.  We take as our perspective the classification of Europe
as either Old Europe or New Europe (a distinction made popular by U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Robert Rumsfeld).  In many ways, other than his
context in reference to the lead up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003,
this division makes sense.  In the post Cold War environment, Old Europe
represented the mostly Western European powers that escaped the clutches
of the old Iron Curtain and are often considered the traditional centers
of power of European governance.  Of "Old Europe,” Germany, France, and
the United Kingdom are perhaps the best representative samples of
leading powers.  We include Russia in this context because of the very
traditional state power role that it has played in European politics, as
one of the five great powers since at least the 1800s.*  
  
 *In this context, “New Europe” is a reflection of the many states that
have spun off of the collapse of the Soviet Union.  As these states
began to find a role of their own in the politics of Europe rather than
simply being satellites for the Soviets, they fundamentally changed the
balance of power in European politics and within the EU.  We will
include Poland in our discussion because of its ascension into the EU in
2004 and the impact its population has made on the distribution of power
in EU politics.  Ukraine is another good example to explore, because it
is the second largest state in Europe and resides in a place of
strategic importance as the gateway of Russian energy supplies into the
EU proper.  With both the EU and the government of Ukraine desiring
closer ties and eventual integration, Ukraine is an important test case
for the relationship between Russia and the EU.  Finally, we will take a
look at Turkey, a growing power that seemingly rests both in Europe and
the Middle East.  The question of Turkey in Europe and as a potential EU
member-state provides an import test case for the role of culture and
values in the European experiment.  Its potential inclusion begs the
question: "What does it mean to be a European?"  European nationalism
has played a paradoxical role in European integration.  French
nationalism, for example, has both promoted and hindered European
integration, while German political identity has taken a civilian form
which the European integration project has facilitated.  It will
continue to be a critical political force determining the direction and
characteristics of European integration.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 6.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 3.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 2.5 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Identify Germany’s transition from a military to a civilian power in
    the post World War II era, including serving as a foundation stone
    for peaceful European integration. 
-   Describe the political evolution of France as a nation state seeking
    to restore its grandeur in European and world political affairs to a
    leader of European economic and political integration. 
-   Assess the so-called ‘special relationship’ between the United
    States and the United Kingdom and its impact on the regional
    European and global international behavior of the United Kingdom. 
-   Discuss the impact of the end of the Cold War and the disintegration
    of the USSR upon Russia’s political development into a sovereign
    nation state. 
-   Assess the reassertion of national sovereignty of Poland since the
    end of Communism while viewing itself as a nation demanding
    recognition of its equal dignity and status with the other large,
    old member states of the European Union.
-   Analyze the challenge of determining Ukraine’s place in a Europe
    divided between the European Union, on the one hand, and the
    successor states to the USSR, with Russia claiming a special
    relationship with countries such as Ukraine, which is itself a
    national community whose loyalties are divided between East and
    West.
-   Evaluate the efforts of modern Turkey as a prospective member of the
    European Union and therefore a community seeking to establish its
    European identity but which until World War I was the capital of the
    Ottoman Empire and whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim.

     Instructions: Please read the article for an overview of German
    foreign policy since World War II until the wars in the former
    Yugoslavia, which marked a watershed in German foreign policy.  In
    Yugoslavia, Germany deployed and threatened the use of deadly force
    since the Second World War to enforce a peace settlement among the
    warring parties in Kosovo, an area outside of NATO’s traditional
    area of operations.  Subsequently, Germany would also deploy forces
    in Afghanistan as part of NATO, while refusing to deploy forces in
    Iraq.  Germany now has troops deployed in several ‘out of area’
    operations.  Germany’s transition into a ‘civilian power’ has
    happened under the aegis of European integration, but the author
    concludes that the EU is no longer a ‘civilian power.’

    entirety (14 pages).  Written by a Russian author, this article
    presents the prevailing view among the Russian political authorities
    of the challenges Russia has faced since the disintegration of the
    USSR in 1991.  In addition to security challenges to Russia’s
    territorial boundaries in the Chechnya, it also highlights the
    challenges from Russia’s comparative economic underdevelopment as a
    source of weakness in maintaining Russian sovereignty over its vast
    territory rich in natural resources.  (Note: the reading for Ukraine
    in subunit 3.2.2 illustrates how powerful nationalist political
    interests within Russia view Russia as having special access rights
    to the territory of countries belonging to the former USSR,
    especially to the territory of the other Slavic states, Belarus, and
    Ukraine.)

    It highlights the pro-Russian orientation of the eastern portion of
    Ukraine, which is the power base of the current President, Victor
    Yanukovich.  In return for subsidized Russian gas supplies, Ukraine
    has agreed to extend for many years Russia’s current use of the
    large naval base at Sevastapol, Ukraine as the headquarters for its
    Black Sea fleet, thereby effectively guaranteeing that Ukraine will
    not join NATO or the EU in the foreseeable future.
