**Unit 2: The European Union** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore the institutions and policies of the
European Union.  The European Union represents the collective economic
and political effort of 27 member states as of the inclusion of Bulgaria
and Romania in 2007.  However, the European continent is largely
represented by the EU as a political and economic whole in that all
European states have some degree of connection to this supranational
entity though not all states in Europe are members.  As the EU moves, so
does Europe as a whole, with a few notable exceptions (namely, Russia
and Turkey).*  
  
 *Of course, the history of the EU does not begin in the present.  In
this unit, you will find that the idea of a modern Europe largely began
in the ashes of what was discussed in Unit 1: The Peace of Westphalia,
the development of the nation-state, and the wars of centuries of
attempted Empire.  After the end of World War II, a new idea of what
Europe could be began to develop, marking the beginnings of the peaceful
integration of the continent.  This modern start surfaced with the 1952
European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and continued on until its
present condition. *  
  
 *In Unit 2, we will first look at the expansion and growth of European
cooperation and the direction that growth may take in the future.  We
will then glance at the various key institutions of the EU with an eye
on the limits they have and the reason why they were included in the
various treaties and agreements under which they were developed.  We
will conclude with a discussion of the major policy areas covered under
the auspices of the EU and a current perspective on the degree to which
they represent the policies of European states.  Note that EU
institutions evolve and change to meet public policy challenges which
are often unexpected.  Examples here include the renewed focus on
internal security and greater emphasis on EU border control following
the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001.*
