**Unit 1: Europe: History and Content** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will begin to discuss the idea of Europe. The idea of
Europe has a beginning as much as it has an end.  In this unit, we will
look at key historical epochs in European history in order to better
understand the development of the European identity.  In a course of
this nature, we can begin at almost any point in Europe’s past depending
on what we hope to get at.  Even as we learn history for the analogies
that help us better understand the present, we must be mindful that, at
best, we can only reach an approximation of the times that existed.  For
Europe, we are lucky to have several good points in history that will
offer us a better understanding of the nature of the European experience
and the foundations of the European Union.  The history of Europe plays
a very important role in what it means to be a European.  You will
discover that experience and time have created the unique set of
variables that define modern Europe. *  
 *             
 To start, we will explore the geography of the European continent in
order to better understand the lay of the land that has played such an
important role in European development.  From there, we will begin our
exploration of European history with the Peace of Westphalia of 1648
that ended the Thirty Years War and the lesser known Eighty Years War. 
This important demarcation point marks the effective end of the Holy
Roman Empire on the European continent and the birth of the modern
nation-state.  The 18th Century was a period of consolidation and
definition of the nation-state as actors within Europe took part in
Balance of Power games in what has been termed the Stately Quadrille. 
However, by the end of the French Revolution (1789-1799) and the
beginning of the Concert of Europe (1815), we see Balance of Power games
as maneuvers for power and also as diplomatic means to preserve the
peace.  This 19th Century European system, although in decline from
roughly 1850 onward, would eventually meet its complete collapse with
the advent of World I and emerge from the interwar period and World War
II fundamentally altered.  At this stage, Europe seemingly looked back
upon its history of violence and empire, destruction and power, and
developed a will for a new way of doing business.  It was through this
long experience of war and trial that Europe arrived at the Cold War and
the beginning of the modern European system.  However, this new Europe
had divided loyalties between the Soviet Union in the east and the
offshore balancer, the United States.  Finally, with the end of the Cold
War and the growing closeness of European cooperation, we find that
deeper questions concerning European integration and the role of the
nation-state need to be answered.  These questions ultimately focus on
the challenge of shifting the fundamental loyalty of Europeans away from
their nation states towards an emphasis on loyalty to Europe as an
integral community. *

    summarizes the political significance of the Peace of Westphalia
    ending the “Thirty Years War” for the development of the modern
    Europe state.  It established in European law the principle of the
    separation of the public sphere from the private sphere in the
    governance of community affairs.  It also formally acknowledged the
    end of Papal authority over secular state rulers and laid the legal
    foundation for the principle of the ultimate authority of state
    authorities over the people and affairs of their respective
    territories.
