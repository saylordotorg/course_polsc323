**Unit 4: Select Issues in European Politics** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we delve more deeply into the European integration
project.  The European project is a story of some pretty amazing
successes.  From its very early beginnings in warfare and Empire through
its modern incarnation, no other system of states has managed to come as
far as the EU has in terms of shunning old habits of sovereignty and
security.  As Director-General for External and Politico-Military
Affairs for the EU and noted scholar Robert Cooper  has argued, the
Europeans have embraced a very Post Modern sense of being, where states
willingly accept "mutual interference" in one another’s affairs.  To
explain this differently, rather than solving their issues on the
battlefield, each member-state willing allows its neighbor a vote on how
to handle its affairs.  This, of course, does not mean the Europeans
have entered into a post-political world.  Rather, if anything, issues
that would not normally be political in nature have become
hyper-political.*  
  
 *As we draw this course to a conclusion, we will look at a snapshot of
some of the most pressing issues in European Politics today.  For
example, much of post-industrial Western Europe is experiencing a
graying of the population that threatens to bankrupt the social systems
that helped draw Europeans through the Cold War.  With populations
growing older and birth rates declining, many of these states are
experiencing a surge in minority populations that have been
traditionally isolated from mainstream European life.  Further
confounding these demographic trends is the blurring of the political
lines of the EU, which has allowed the free movement of cheap labor from
Eastern Europe into the heart of western European society.*  
  
 *Setting aside demographic and social pressures, Europe is also
experiencing renewed security threats that have evolved in our more
globalized society.  Terrorism and transnational crime, while not new,
have taken on new meaning in the age of the Global War on Terror and
easier access to weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  Tensions in the
Middle East and missile proliferation issues find their centers
literally on Europe's front door, even as Europe feels the pinch from
the much tighter energy market that exists in the twenty-first century. 
While no one seriously expects major war to break out in Europe in the
foreseen future, the Europeans find themselves needed in the quest to
keep a more secure international environment. *  
  
 *We conclude the course with perhaps the most pressing of issues in
European politics today: What does it mean to be a European in the
modern world?  How much of the nation-state are Europeans willing to
give up in order to form this new identity as a European?  And finally,
what role should Europe play in the international environment?  The
adoption and implementation of the answers to these questions constitute
the substance of European Union policy making in the twenty-first
century.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Identify critical demographic trends in Europe that are posing
    public policy challenges to the social democratic model of inclusion
    and integration of growing minorities within the existing national
    communities of Europe.
-   Assess the economic and political capacities of the advanced social
    democratic welfare state in Europe to continue to provide for the
    political participatory, representational and social justice demands
    of the peoples of Europe, cooperating within the framework of the
    European Union.  
-   Critique the contemporary security challenges to the economic and
    political welfare of the peoples of the European Union, which have
    their roots before the end of the Cold War but which now occupy
    center stage among European security concerns.
-   Discuss trends in future European political development which
    promote or challenge the emergence of a common European identity
    among the peoples of the European Union, evaluating its relationship
    to existing regional and national European identities that have been
    a foundation of European democratic cooperation and competition to
    the present.

    poses a major social, economic and immigration policy challenge to
    Europe.

    of European Union-level policy making to the regional governments of
    Germany, Belgium, and Spain.  Belgium and Spain’s constitutional
    devolution of central authority has occurred within the context of
    European integration, whereas German’s “Basic Law” constitution was
    established before the EU was formally established.  Consequently,
    the United Kingdom’s own movements towards devolution should
    comparatively examine these cases to guide its direction.

    political participation rates in EU elections, is not necessarily an
    indication of a failure to create a European identity community, and
    European political theorists have noted that the rise of
    technocratic politics in complex modern societies produces an apathy
    that is at least peaceful.
